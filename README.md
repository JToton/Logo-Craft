## Description

Logo Craft is an npm inquirer application that generates a custom logo based on user input. It provides a simple and interactive way to create personalized logos for your projects or brands. With Logo Craft, you can choose from three different shapes (circle, triangle, and square), specify colors for the shape and text, and add up to three characters of text to your logo. The video demonstration and README.md for the video can be located here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12V4GVGczuoW8tCANlWPiE6gGtAu6uWtUA9pevCjPCBk/edit?usp=sharing
